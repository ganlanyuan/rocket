It has also been painful to read articles about the case in different newspapers where the upbringing of the children has been presented negatively without knowing the actual conditions," Ruth's father was quoted as saying. "We who live here in the home and have had the children around us since they were born, must be the ones who know best how the children have been with their parents."</div>

For us who love our grandchildren so much, it would be inconceivable to know that they were not happy and not to intervene. After all, we are well informed people."</div>
