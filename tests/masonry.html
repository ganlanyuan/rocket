              <p>
                I don’t remember Justice Scalia’s ever missing an argument in my eight years of covering the Supreme Court. He must have been recused occasionally, or sick, or stuck somewhere given his near-constant travels. But I can’t imagine what a Supreme Court argument will be like without him.

                Pivotal Nursing Home Suit Raises a Simple Question: Who Signed the Contract?

                Keep everything secret. That’s the biggest thing the White House will try to do this week during its consideration of a replacement for Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court.

    <h3>Where Will Bush Voters Go?</h3>
    <p>But if the White House has its way, all of that will happen directly under the noses of people like me, and without leaking. In 2009 and 2010, Mr. Obama’s advisers did that pretty well, though word of the president’s in-person interviews quickly spread. </p>

      <p> On Monday, Justice Scalia’s chair and the bench in front of it will be draped in black. The arguments, in a pair of minor cases, will no doubt be muted. Some losses start to feel real only when you return to the routines of daily life. </p>

    <p>This time, with the stakes so high, I expect my fellow White House correspondents and I will try hard to pierce the wall of confidentiality that Mr. Obama and his aides have already begun to erect. </p>

    <h3>Apple Moves to Shift Battle Over Unlocking iPhone to Capitol Hill</h3>
    <p>Is the Supreme Court hanging in the balance a winning campaign issue? Senator Ted Cruz sure thinks so. He has spent much of the last week assuring voters that he’s the only conservative fit to appoint a true “constitutionalist” to replace Justice Scalia. </p>

    <h3>5G Is a New Frontier for Mobile Carriers and Tech Companies</h3>
    <p>It gets a little more personal on Monday as the Senate returns after a week’s recess. Now the conflict over how to replace Justice Scalia switches from one waged long distance through news releases and media interviews to one that is more face-to-face as senators converge on the floor and in Capitol hallways. </p>
