              <p> I don’t remember Justice Scalia’s ever missing an argument in my eight years of covering the Supreme Court. He must have been recused occasionally, or sick, or stuck somewhere given his near-constant travels. But I can’t imagine what a Supreme Court argument will be like without him. </p>
